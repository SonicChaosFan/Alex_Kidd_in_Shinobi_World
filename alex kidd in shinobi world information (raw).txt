    :: ROUND 1 - KABUTO ::                                              [004A]


    : Level 1 :

    Alright, let's begin! The game barely starts and you already have to get
    rid of two red ninjas. They should be no problem, just press Button 1 and
    Alex Kidd's sword will do the job. Go foreward and when you reach the grey
    post press up and you'll climb it. Once you're above the building press
    and hold button 1: Alex Kidd will turn into a fireball and then release it
    to kill all enemies on your way. Now you should be at the top of the
    building. There's a chest with some heart get it and kill the rifleman
    that's on the box (just jump and slice your sword). Down there there is a
    guy that keeps throwing this boomerang-like sword. To kill him, you must
    wait until he throws his weapon, when he's without it is your chance
    to strike back. This one you can kill from behind, he won't turn. Just
    beware of the red Ninja that comes towards you once you're on the floor.
    Go forward and there will be another boomerang guy, just stay a little
    closer and as soon as he throws it, jump and kill him.

    On the top of the next building there is a treasure with some heart, just
    jump and break the chest. A Frog Ninja will apear, kill him the same way
    you "killed" the chest. You should have no problem next, but just in
    case... Jump on the first box then jump on the building. From the building
    jump on the upper box to proceed.
    A red ninja will come as soon as you hit the ground. Go forward until you
    see a grey post, press up and on the top of it press and hold Button 1
    until Alex becomes a fireball. You'll go to the top of a building where a
    Rifleman were standing, just get the spear on the treasure and get down.
    Be carefull with the two Red Ninjas. If you want you can go back and kill
    the boomerang guy. Go down, but be carefull! Jump the farther you can, so
    you can strike the boomerang guy from behind. There's also a star-throwing
    red ninja. Just dodge the shurikens and kill the bastard. Proceed to the
    next area.


    : Level 2 :

    Just go forward and two Frog Ninjas will fall, they shouldn't be any
    problem by now. Go up the ladder and kill the red ninja. Go left and jump
    through the plataforms, just wait to the boomerang dude get far enough for
    you to go up and kill rifleman. Kill the boomerang guy and proceed through
    the ladder. When you're going up there'll be two riflemen just get past
    the first and stay on the middle of them. Wait for the shot of the second
    and continue.

    There will be a treasure with a Power Up for your sword, just break the
    chest and get it (with this Powerup you can deflect the shurikens
    (ninja-stars) with your sword. Now Jump and press button 1 to kill the red
    ninja on the top of the boxes. Wait for the lower one to go to the far
    left and fall. Be ready to press button 1 as soon as you hit the ground to
    kill him. Go up using the ladder. Once again you'll have to wait to the
    boomerang man get away from you. Once you see it's clear just jump on the
    plataform and use your skills to kill him. There is also a chest with some
    heart on this plataform.

    There's no secret now, but you must be carefull in order not to fall of.
    Wait for the moving plataform to get near you and then jump. Wait for it
    to get down and jump again to proceed. Carefull, in the next plataform
    there'll be two red ninjas. As you'll go forward you'll find a
    star-throwing ninja on a plataform, do not be affraid, avoid the stars,
    run, jump and kill him! Don't worry if you lose some hearts, there will be
    one on the next plataform. Careful as you jump to the next plataform,
    there'll be a red ninja waiting there, so as the other one, but as soon as
    you fall on the other another one will appear. Go forward and kill the red
    ninja, walk right a little further and there will be a star throwing red
    ninja, just avoid his stars, get close and kill him. Now, enter the
    building.

    Inside the building, use the same techiniches to kill the first red ninja:
    wait on the border, when his on the far right get down and kill him. Go on
    and when you reach the shining golden blocks just press down and then use
    your sword to break it. When you're down, just break the other blocks and
    kill the red ninja. Continue down the building. Once you break down the
    two golden blocks, be ready to kill a red ninja. Keep going down using the
    same way. Another red ninja will be there. Keep this up until you reach a
    place that there's two different places to  break, just break the two left
    blocks.

    Go left, to go up just jump on the wall and once you hit it, press the
    jump button again, so you'll jump to the other wall, keep doing this until
    you reach the top with two treasures: one containing a spear and another
    with a heart. Fall down and go right. Press jump + Up and you hold on the
    white bar. Press and hold button 1 until you become a fireball, then
    release it. Pretty cool, heh? :P
    Now the path is cleared, just do as you did in the left wall and go up.
    Just jump and throw a spear on that dumb red ninja and proceed to the
    exit.


    : Level 3 :

    Boss Battle - KABUTO

    Easy boss. To beat Kabuto shoot spears on him until he turns small, when
    he does, duck down and shoot some more. If you do everything as said there
    should not be the need for dosging shots, but do so in case you need.

    Once you've beaten him, that's the end of stage three.

        

    :: ROUND 2 - HELI ::                                                 [004B]
    

    : Level 1 :
    
    Alright, if found to reach Round 2 was pretty damn easy we're getting
    along just fine :)

    We're on a harbor-like area, but let's quit all this babbling and get
    sweaty!

    Just go forward as you might already assumed, a strage guy in a diving
    suit will apear, just kill him and jump to the next plataform. Oh, and by
    the way, it doesn't matter if you fall into the water, it won't kill you.
    Just keep it up and another diving man will appear, just before the big
    plataform with the chest. Continue until you check the Green Ninja, keep
    some distance so you don't hit him, just jump and then slice the sword
    upon him. Now the path is clear you can jump on the plataform and go to
    the one in the left, to take the chest with a heart.

    Continue to the right and you will see a Green Ninja, just kill the guy
    and go on, jump to the small plataform and the diving suit guy will appear
    again, just kill him like you did before. Continue jumping until you reach
    the bigger plataform with a Green Ninja on it, go on and you'll see a
    rifleman. Just get rid of him, jump on the crates and continue to the
    right. While jumping between plataforms you'll encounter a ninja in the
    diving suit, get rid of him and continue. Kill the Green Ninja and enter
    the lighthouse, the door with a red light, just press up on the D-Pad and
    you'll enter the door.

      Secret Room

      You should already know what to do, just in case... Press jump + Up on
      the D-Pad, then hold button 1 to perform the fireball magic, than
      release the button. On the other bar just press Down + Jump, and perform
      the fireball magic, continue doing this until you reach the two treasure
      chests containing a heart and a spear. Go back and get out of the
      lighthouse.

    Alright, let's go again. The Green Ninja you've killed is back, so kill
    him again (much easier with the spear, eh?) and continue. There will be a
    star-throwing Green Ninja, just kill him and proceed (remember you can
    block the stars by throwing spears upon them). Kill the first rifleman and
    get the chest with a star, go up on the plataforms, jump and kill the
    second one. There should be another chest with a heart on it just after
    the second rifleman, get it and continue on your journey.
    
    Once you go right you'll see a chest and another rifleman, don't worry,
    just get on the highest plataform and kill the guy. Because you can't 
    destroy chests with the spear when you are too far away from them you'll
    have to jump from the highest plataform and press right while you jump,
    when you're close enough shoot and you will be able to break it. It will
    leave a heart (perhaps, if you're lucky you may find a live here). To get
    it you may face the third plataform right to left, jump and then jump again
    to perform a Ninja jump to the right, keep holding righ on the D-Pad while
    you're in the air. You may have to do it 2 or 3 times, but it's not that 
    difficult.
   
    Well, as you continues you'll find a diving suit man, kill him and go on. 
    On the ship plataform there's a Green Ninja, don't worry with the one on
    the ship, if you want you can kill him later. Enter the ship!
    
    As soon as you get on the ship throw a spear, there'll be a Green Ninja 
    waiting for you. Climb on the ladder, and go to the right. Stand on the 
    golden block and throw a spear at the Green Ninja on the left. If you want
    you can check the upper part of the ship by getting out through the left
    door, there will be only a Green Ninja there. Well, get down to the plata-
    form from where you came, approach the ladder (but don't climb it). You'll
    have to be fast now, in order not to fall off, jump to the left, as soon 
    as you touch the golden blocks hit it and break it and press up fast to
    climb the ladder. Remember, you can't break it throwing spears when you 
    are far away from them! Now you have a clear shot of the Green Ninja from
    the plataform you came from. Just climb the ladder and break the chest. 
    You'll get a magic and become a Hurricane! Just go down and kill the Ninja
    just by touching him. Continue down and kill another Green Ninja. 

    Go to the right, and break the golden blocks. Go and get to the bar (remem-
    ber? If you're above it Down + Jump, below it Up + Jump) and move to the
    left, use the fireball magic (press and hold button one, then release it)
    and press left to stay on the red block. Just break the golden blocks and
    head to the Exit Door. That's it for Level 1!


    : Level 2 :
 
    Well, I bet you're thinking: Now this is becoming interesting! And you're 
    right! Level 2 is on the sea, and things are getting a little harder.

    Just as you start you'll see two Barracudas, be carefull, they can be a 
    damn pain in the ass. To kill them, you have to hit them twice. But it's 
    all about timming, when he sees you he'll open his mouth and come to 
    attack you. Just stay calm, in front of him, and when he's near enough 
    just strike, he'll fall back a little, wait for the approach and hit again.
    That should about do it. If you find this too damn difficult you can stay
    at the top of the water jumping them, but if you like danger, just go and
    kill them all!

    After you kill the two Barracudas, just break the blocks and get the chest,
    it will give you Power Up for your sword (wich will make easier to kill
    those damn fishes!). Be ready for another Barracuda just after the blocks.
    If you hit them from behind or down it'll need only one strike. Proceed 
    (be carefull with those spikes) and a diving suit guy will fall, kill 
    him and go on. Break the blocks and another diving suit will appear, just 
    do as the other one and proceed. Break the blocks to make it easy and a 
    third diving bastard will show up. Just kill him and go up for that chest 
    that's calling you. Just get near the crate on the right and use the Ninja
    Jump (jump and jump again on the crate's side). There'll be a Life on the 
    chest.

    Go on and when you see two chests and something that keeps throwing balls
    just go down and destroy the chests and get the two lives. Go down a 
    little into the hole, BUT DO NOT FALL OFF YET! (if you are a bad boy and
    already did enter the hole, just skip to Secret Room #2) Just go enought
    to hit that monster with you're powered up sword. A Barracuda will appear,
    and if you can't get of the hole just press jump and you'll be fine. 

      Secret Room #1
      
      Proceed and there'll be another Barracuda, just kill and go on. Jump and 
      you're now out of the water, jump to the plafarm on the right and then 
      jump again to the right. You'll be now at the to of the plataform and
      off screen. Just keep going to the right until you reach the secret area
      with a chest with a heart on it.

    Once you got the life, head back to the place that were two chests.  Be 
    carefull, your enemies will be there again! After killing them, fall into
    the hole and you'll be on Secreet Room #2.

      Secret Room #2
      
      There's a diving suit dude (caution! this one throws ninja stars, just
      deflect it with your sword, if you have got the Power) just as you enter
      the place. Go down, break the blocks and get the chest with a life. From
      that point turn right, break the blocks, kill the Barracudas and
      proceed. On the upper plataform you will see two chests, the first one
      is easy, just approach and break it to get a life, for the second one,
      head down and then when you're bellow the golden blocks go up and break
      them to reach the chest with another life. Go forward and you'll reach a
      place with three different paths. 
      The path on the left will lead you to a dead end. Take the path on the
      right to reach a chest with a spear. Now take the path on the center, 
      and when you reach the second bifurcation go to the right one to get a 
      chest with a heart on it. Just keep going up.

    Now that you're out of the water head to the Exit Door (Don't mind the 
    left door, it will lead you to the place where you entered Secret Room #1). 
    This is the end of Level 2!
    
    : Level 3 :

    Boss Battle - HELI
 
    Don't worry, this is as easy as the first boss. All you have to do is to
    destroy 15 little choppers. Just use your spear throw to do the job.
    Do not jump, jumping it will only make it easier for the choppers to hit
    you, stay on the ground and start shooting as crazy. You will finish them
    in no time.



    :: ROUND 3 - ROBSTER ::                                             [004C]


    : Level 1 :

    Hey, here we go for Round 3. In the begginnin' there's a crown there, do
    NOT jump, he will come to the floor, just keep proceeding slowly and when
    it comes, slice it in two. Fall on that hole and you're now in...

      Secret Room #1

      Now, there you have one extra life, cool, heh? GET THE CHEST ON THE LEFT
      FIRST, with this done, break the chest in the right, get the Ninja's
      Cristal Ball and Alex will turn into a tornado for some seconds, just
      go up, back to the previous area.

    Well, if you are back the patform where you began again, just head right
    and press Jump + D-Button (UP) to climb the rope (if you are already on
    the above platform because of the Tornado, just continue from here on).
    Caution with the false floor and the crow, there's another rope on the
    left, so here we go again, but this time you'll see a chest in the far
    right. Align yourself with the chest and then press and hold the Button 1
    and you'll do the Fireball. Just get the stuff inside the chest and go
    back to the rope you were, this time, climb it to the top and fall of to
    the right. A stealth fish wil come up in your back and our friend crow
    again, just get rid of them, and go to the right rope. Now, let's find the
    secret room, see that hole in the left wall? That's there, do the Fireball
    again and reach it.

      Secret Room #2

      Now you see two crows and three chests. Get rid of the first crow and
      get the first chest. Now this is a little difficult, you'll have to jump
      and slice the crow at the air and not fall on the bamboo spikes. Get the
      other chest you see and climb the rope, do the fireball and get the
      spears. Now get to the rope in the same direction as the hole and do the
      fireball to come back.

    Now, fall down (caution with the stealth fish again) and kill the crow
    again. Avoid the false floor and Climb the right rope and get to the top
    of it, jump to the left platform (caution: the stealth devlish fish from
    hell appears again here, and the false floor) and get to the left rope.
    Jump off to the right and kill the crow. Proceed right, now.

    As you arrive you see a yellow ninja (just throw a spear at him) and a
    strange rounding animal, just pass by him, you'll see a treasure, go to
    the platform just before it, squat down and throw a spear at the rifleman
    right ahead. Get the treasure and go up to the next platform. There will
    be a wetaher crow, he is going to throw some flashes at you, throw a spear
    from a distance.
    
    Go forward and you'll find the rounding animal thing again, he will not
    attack, just pass him again, but try not falling on the bamboo spikes.
    Before get the chest, throw a spear at the ninja from the platform you are
    now get the chest and to the next platform. And now you'll have to jump on
    that floating block up there, if you fall, just proceed. Get the next
    treasure, it will contain the Ninja's Cristal Ball, and will turn Alex
    into a tornado, just go ahead with that flying the higher you can. You
    should fall between a rounding animal and a rifleman, kill him and
    proceed.

    Just jump to the next platform, and you'll see a chest, there's a weather
    crow just waiting for you, try dodging the flashes and throw a spear when
    he's far enough. Now there's an abism and a floating block that will fall
    once you get on it. THAT'S THE HARDEST JUMP IN THE GAME, if you fall you
    get back a fricking huge lot. But, that's with you, take some distance and
    jump when you are almost falling, go ahead and jump it to the next floor,
    where a star-throwing ninja is waiting for you. Kill him and this level is
    over!


    
    : Level 2 :

    Well, now we're in a cave with lava all over the place, first, jump on the
    first floating grass and then jump to lef left, you must have found the...

      SECRET PASSAGE

      Now this area gets much easier. You walk above the screen and does not
      get attacked by any enemy. Cool, heh? Just go through the passage and
      watch those bamboo spikes falling there (thank us they're not falling
      over your head), just proceed to the right and get the two chests.

      After you've got the chests, you may come back and pass the whole stuff
      again (wich we do not recomend), or just fall off over the green
      gelatine stuff. If you want to proceed from here, just skip the next
      paragraph.


    IF YOU DID COME BACK:
    Pass the droplets lava and jump to the floating grass. Fall on the next
    piece of land. Now you see there are bamboo spikes at the ceiling.
    Some of them fall (if you have one through the SECRET PASSAGE, they did
    already fall, so it won't bother you), you can differ them by the color.
    Now, do a quick move: jump to the piece of floor and then just jump over
    the next green stuff, but do it fast enough, or else a bamboo spike is
    going to fall over your head. Now there are more three pieces of lands,
    they all have falling spikes above them (again, if you've gone through the
    secret passage, just don't worry about them falling). Just go as quick as
    you can. In the first one, not even jump, just walk and fall on it, and
    then quickly jump until you reach the treasure chest, get the heart and
    move on. Now you have a jumping lava just before a droplet lava, use your
    skills go through. Do it until you
    reach a floating grass and see a green gelatine-like monster.
    At this point you're just right where you would be if you had gone
    through the secret passage. Just continue reading.

    IF YOU DID NOT COME BACK (START READING FROM HERE):
    Just don't bother about the gelatine stuff (if you want to score, once
    hit it it divides in four, so might be a good idea, if you don't mind
    scoring, just leave it alone. (If you want to kill him, do it and jump to
    the left floating grass quickly, or else he is gonna hurt you, them go
    back and kill the gelatine-planary dude).

    Now pass by the jumpin' lavas, run through the droplets lavas, and fall
    there on the right, it might be a little difficult, but jump and press
    D-Button (UP) to hold the rope. Now get to the top of it and do the
    Fireball (hold Button 1 and hold D-Button (RIGHT), then just release
    Button 1), and you've reached the secret room #2, if you fell on the
    rope's hole, just skip the next paragraph.

      SECRET ROOM #2

      You've got a Powerup right there. Just ignore the rope and jump straight
      to the other side, get the stuff and fall down. If you entered this
      area, skip the next paragraph.

    IF YOU DID NOT ENTER THE SECRET ROOM #2:
    You fell on a green floating floor, just fall to the left now and get upon
    the yellow moving stuff. But do not expect it will carry you through the
    spikes. You have to walk upon it on your own. Get to the next piece of
    floor and get upon the other yellow-moving car, walk on it and jump to the
    floating grass. (just continue the reading...)

    IF YOU DID ENTER THE SECRET ROOM #2 (START READING FROM HERE):
    Get the chest and jump to the next stair-like floor.
    Jump into the yellow car, then WALK right together him and jump off before
    it falls in the lava. Don't mind the rope, just jump straight to the chest
    and get the spears. Now fall off.

    Get the chest and proceed to the right jumping over these moving rocks.
    Once you've past it, there's another one easier to pass. Just go until you
    reach a falling drop of lava, with a moving rock on its right. Just jump
    on the rock and on to the platform. Go through another falling drop of
    lava, and jump on the rock and to the floating brown platform again. Avoid
    the jumping lava and get to the silver floating rock. Jump off him before
    it falls. And proceed to the exit.

    
    : Level 3 :

    Boss Battle - ROBSTER

    OK, now we are gonna face this crazy lobster thing. He throws upon you
    some yellow stuff that look like cut potatoes to me, that's his only
    attack besides jumping  over the place.

    If you got the Spears, it's gonna be pretty easy to go over him. Just run
    to the left side of the screen and stay just a little away from the wall,
    and shoot him like hell. If you do not got the spears try hitting him when
    he jumps (this time, he's unprotected) and repeat it around 4 times. Well,
    he's gone, time for a delicious dinner now.



    :: ROUND 4 - HANZO ::                                                 [004D]


    : Level 1 :

    This is the last part, don't give up now! We're almost there.

    You're willing to kick the butt of that good-for-nothing Ninja that
    kidnapped you girl, eh? So let's go!
 
    You start the level and you already see that damn bird and a cannon-like
    thing. Now, here you'll have to get the timing of the bird and of the 
    cannon ball. The cannon ball will keep comming, the bird will only attack
    you if you approach. Just make so you can jump the ball and hit the bird 
    with your sword at the same time, you might need some practice, but it's 
    not that difficult.
    
    Continue to the other side of the cannon, be carefull: it will throw balls
    on both sides, so don't get too crazy on the other side. Continue to the 
    right and jump to the next plataform. Now you'll have to be sure you got
    some jumping skills. If you fall, don't worry, you can continue through
    the underground path.


      SURFACE PATH:
      At the other side of the cannon, just be ready to jump and slice the
      bird that'll be waiting for you. It will make easier if as soon as you
      get on the smaller plataform you jump to the other one. That way you
      won't fall by accident. Just proceed and be carefull with the cannon.
      On the other plataform jump you'll have to use just the same techniches
      you've used on the first one. The only difference is that's a chest with
      a heart on the smaller plataform. Continue and again, be carefull with
      the cannon.
      On the plataform with a tree, just after that cannon, jump and kill the 
      bird to proceed. There'll be more two cannons and one bird ahead. Just 
      make sure you won't get hit. 
      Now fall into the hole.

      UNDERGROUND PATH:
      If you fall of on the first or second hole, that's where you end up. If 
      you fall on the other holes you should appear just ahead.
      Head left, avoid the cannon balls and get the chest with a heart. Now 
      proceed to the right, make sure you won't get hit by those spikes.
      Continue to the right and a skull man will appear, just get rid of him
      and go on. Be very carefull with your jumps so you don't hit the spikes!
      When you meet the guy on a ledge, just wait stay on the plataform below
      and when he's near enough just jump and slice. Go on to the right until
      you see the white bar.
    

    
    Well, now either if you used the surface or the underground path you
    should end up here. Get down on the bar (Use Down + Jump, and then jump
    again). Go to the right crouch and move (Move using Down + Right).
    Now use the bar to cast the fireball magic (Jump + UP), then press and
    hold button 1 until you become a fireball) to get the two chests with
    some heart. 

    Now use the bar to go up, and press right when you reach the surface to
    get the power up for your sword on the chest at the top of the roof. Fall,
    and enter the building through the door and get out through the other door

    On the outside, don't worry if you fall off. But do as hard as you can
    to stay on the surface. If you fall you end up on a lake area, you'll
    just have to go right and kill the fishes, but it's too damn boring.

    Well, just jump and kill the first bird. Be carefull, the one-wood 
    plataform will fall as soon as you hit it, so be fast. Once you reach the
    other bigger plataform you'll see a bird and three one-wood plataforms,
    just kill the bird and jump fast on the others to get to the bigger one.
    Be carefull, the first wood of the bigger plataform will fall too!

    Now when you're on the right plataform with two chests bellow it, just
    head left and fall between the bigger plataform and the one-wood. You'll
    fall on an invisible path, that way you'll be able to get the two chests:
    one with a heart, and another with a Tornado magic. Just get it and head
    right until you reach another two chests: one with a heart and another
    with a spear. Go to the left (don't worry, there's also an invisible 
    path here) and jump on the plataform with the cannon. Just go on to the
    right and kill the skull man. Proceed and you'll find the Exit Door.
    That's it for Level 1!


    : Level 2 :

    Here we go again! Well, this first screen is pretty easy, just learn 
    how the arrows behave and clim on the left ladder to go down on the right.
    There aren't any secrets here, just break the chests with two hearts and
    proceed to the next room.

    Now you'll have to kick Kabuto's ass again. It's a little more difficult
    since you don't have your spears right now, but don't worry, you can 
    handle him. 
    Just stay a little far from him and wait for his fireball, once it hits
    the ground for the first time it will go up again, that's when you go
    bellow it and strike Kabuto. Keep doing this until he goes small, now 
    just go at his back, press down and strike until he dies.

    On the next room, approach the block and it'll fall. When it's almost
    at the top it's your chance to jump. Get the chests and repeat this
    on the other block.

    Now you'll have to defeat Robster again, It's much harder because you
    don't have the spears, but do the following: when he throws his potatoes
    at you, just dodge them and attack once he's jumping (that's his weak
    point, he's not protected while jumping), slice him around four times, and
    it's done.

    This room can be pretty hard if you don't have a little jump skill. Just
    avoid the crystals at all cost. I recomend you to stay at the far left 
    of the room to learn how the red ledges behave. Once you see the order of
    the ledges just jump the crystals, go right and when the first ledge 
    appear jump on it, and continue to the others until you reach the Exit
    Door. And so is the end of Level 2.


    : Level 3 :

    Final Boss Battle - HANZO

    Finally! That's what you've been waiting the all game, huh? Now, let's
    finish this clown face right now!

    The beggining it's very difficult, you have to get the right timing
    so you won't get hit those glows that come out of his body. Once he
    jumps get as close as you can (but don't touch him!) and when the glow
    is out strike! You gotta repeat it four times before he's dead.
    
    When he's gone, the Tornado Ninja will appear. This one is rather easy.
    Just gotta be fast! Stay near him, crouch and stab. Repeat this until
    he's dead. Don't give him time to release those twisters on you, keep
    hitting him.
    
    No, he's not dead! Now he comes as a jumping ninja that leaves a shadow
    when he jumps. Just make sure to give him no time to jump, get near him
    and strike. You can kill a shadow just by hitting it once. This guy should
    give you no problem, as I said, you just have to hit him so he can not 
    jump so often. 

    Once he's dead you'll have beaten the game, congratulations ;). Now enjoy
    the ending and the credits. Hope it have helped.
